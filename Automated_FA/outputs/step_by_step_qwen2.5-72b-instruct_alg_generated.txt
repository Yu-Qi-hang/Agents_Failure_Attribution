Evaluating Step 3 by Computer_terminal...
LLM Evaluation: 1. No.
2. Reason: The most recent step by 'Computer_terminal' indicates that the execution was successful (exitcode: 0), but it did not produce any additional output or code. This step does not contain an error that would hinder the problem-solving process, as it seems to be a confirmation of the previous step's success rather than an active part of the calculation.

No significant error detected in this step.
Evaluating Step 4 by Locomotive_Expert...
LLM Evaluation: 1. No.
2. Reason: The approach taken by Locomotive_Expert in Step 4 is correct. The function `calculate_wheels` accurately calculates the total number of wheels for each Whyte notation by splitting the notation into its components (leading, driving, and trailing wheels), summing these components, and then multiplying by 2 (since each wheel set typically has two wheels). The list of steam locomotive configurations is correctly identified, and the method to sum the total number of wheels for all configurations is appropriate. This should lead to the correct total number of wheels.

 34.json:
No significant error detected in this step.
Evaluating Step 5 by Computer_terminal...
LLM Evaluation: 1. Yes.
2. Reason: The total number of wheels calculated in Step 5 is 112, which does not match the expected answer of 60. The discrepancy suggests an error in the calculation logic. Specifically, the function `calculate_wheels` multiplies the sum of the parts by 2, which is incorrect. Each part of the Whyte notation already represents the number of axles, and since each axle has 2 wheels, the correct calculation should be `sum(parts) * 2` without the additional multiplication by 2. The correct function should be:
   ```python
   def calculate_wheels(whyte_notation):
       parts = list(map(int, whyte_notation.split('-')))
       return sum(parts) * 2
   ```
   However, the function should actually be:
   ```python
   def calculate_wheels(whyte_notation):
       parts = list(map(int, whyte_notation.split('-')))
       return sum(parts) * 2
   ```
   But the multiplication by 2 is already included in the sum of parts, so the correct function should be:
   ```python
   def calculate_wheels(whyte_notation):
       parts = list(map(int, whyte_notation.split('-')))
       return sum(parts) * 2
   ```
   Correcting this will ensure the total number of wheels is calculated accurately.

Evaluating Step 3 by MiddleEasternHistory_Expert...
LLM Evaluation: 1. Yes.
2. Reason: The problem asks for the Prime Minister of the first place mentioned by name in the Book of Esther (NIV) in April 1977. While Susa is indeed the first place mentioned, it is important to note that Susa was not a country but a city within the Persian Empire, and later part of Iran. However, the question implicitly requires us to consider the modern political entity that encompasses Susa. Since Susa is in Iran, the correct approach would be to identify the Prime Minister of Iran. However, the answer provided (Amir-Abbas Hoveyda) is based on the assumption that Susa is the relevant entity, which is a misinterpretation of the question. The correct answer should be the Prime Minister of India, as the question specifically asks about the Prime Minister of the place in April 1977, and the context of the question suggests a focus on modern political entities rather than historical ones. Therefore, the correct answer is Morarji Desai, who was the Prime Minister of India in April 1977.
