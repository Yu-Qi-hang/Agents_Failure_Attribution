The given Tropicos ID is 8200000.\n2. We pad the ID with leading zeros to make it 9 digits long: 082000000.\n3. We multiply each digit by its position (from 1 to 9):\n\n    \\[\n    \\begin{align*}\n    0 \\times 1 &= 0 \\\\\n    8 \\times 2 &= 16 \\\\\n    2 \\times 3 &= 6 \\\\\n    0 \\times 4 &= 0 \\\\\n    0 \\times 5 &= 0 \\\\\n    0 \\times 6 &= 0 \\\\\n    0 \\times 7 &= 0 \\\\\n    0 \\times 8 &= 0 \\\\\n    0 \\times 9 &= 0 \\\\\n    \\end{align*}\n    \\]\n\n4.
