Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nFind the latest chronological year date written in the image on the webpage found when following the first citation reference link on the latest version of Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page as of August 2023.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. The Web Researcher will navigate to Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page and locate the first citation reference link.\n2. The Web Researcher will follow the link to the webpage and identify the image on the page.\n3. The Historian will analyze the image and extract the latest chronological year date written in it.\n4. The Verification Specialist will verify the accuracy and authenticity of the extracted date.\n\n## Output format\nThe latest chronological year date written in the image.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The task must be completed by extracting the date from the image on the webpage found by following the first citation reference link on Carl Nebel's Wikipedia page as of August 2023.\n- The extracted date must be verified for accuracy and authenticity.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe task has not been completed yet. The web search indicated the relevant link to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston (MFAH) collection page but extracting the latest chronological year date from the image failed due to an image identification error.\n\nThe attempt to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the image using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) encountered an `UnidentifiedImageError`. This indicates that the program could not identify the fetched image file, preventing further analysis.\n\nErrors or issues in the conversation:\n1. The exact image URL was not verified to ensure it points directly to an image file suitable for OCR.\n2.

After studies in [Hamburg](/wiki/Hamburg \"Hamburg\") and Paris, he travelled to [America](/wiki/Americas \"Americas\"),[[1]](#cite_note-thb-1) where he was a resident of [Mexico](/wiki/Mexico \"Mexico\") from 1829 until 1834. In 1836, he published in Paris his renowned illustrated work on that country—*Voyage pittoresque et archéologique dans la partie la plus intéressante du Méxique*, with 50 [lithographs](/wiki/Lithography \"Lithography\") made from his paintings, twenty of which were hand-colored, and an introduction by [Alexander von Humboldt](/wiki/Alexander_von_Humboldt \"Alexander von Humboldt\").[[2]](#cite_note-Sloan_a22-2)\n\nIn 1851, he published together with journalist [George Wilkins Kendall](/wiki/George_Wilkins_Kendall \"George Wilkins Kendall\") some of his paintings of the events of the [Mexican–American War](/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War \"Mexican–American War\") in the book *The War between the United States and Mexico Illustrated.* Kendall had been a war correspondent and saw the opportunity to publish a major account of the war. The two came to an agreement to collaborate as the war was ending, Kendall having apparently been familiar with Nebel's earlier work. While Kendall went to Paris to cover events in 1848, Nebel remained in Mexico for an unknown length of time to complete the initial sketches for the book's illustrations. Nebel had returned to Hamburg, and Kendall chafed at the slowness of completion of the project, but it was completed in 1850 and published in 1851. The book contained twelve color lithographs done by [Adolphe Jean-Baptiste Bayot](/wiki/Adolphe_Jean-Baptiste_Bayot \"Adolphe Jean-Baptiste Bayot\") and was printed by [Joseph-Rose Lemercier](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph-Rose_Lemercier \"fr:Joseph-Rose Lemercier\"), a leading lithographer.[[3]](#cite_note-3) In both cases, Nebel's illustrations were enhanced by his making use of the newest printing developments in France, especially techniques for adding color to the prints.[[4]](#cite_note-4) The prints from the Mexican war series were distributed in several different formats, as a single print, as a set of 12, a portfolio with text, and in the bound, folio-sized book.[[5]](#cite_note-5)\n\nThe most famous in the Mexican war series is his depiction of General [Winfield Scott](/wiki/Winfield_Scott \"Winfield Scott\")'s 1847 entry to the main square *[Zócalo](/wiki/Z%C3%B3calo \"Zócalo\")* of Mexico City, with the U.S. flag flying over the [National Palace](/wiki/National_Palace_(Mexico) \"National Palace (Mexico)\"). It is almost identical to his illustration done a decade and a half before. The war scene Nebel presents is closer to the reality on the ground, where the conquering U.S. forces were not welcomed by the resident population, particularly by a street person (*lépero*) about to hurl a rock at the invaders.[[6]](#cite_note-6) Although Kendall's text and Nebel's illustrations attempt to be true to the accounts of battle, there is no evidence that either one was at the [Battle of Buena Vista](/wiki/Battle_of_Buena_Vista \"Battle of Buena Vista\"), located in a remote part of northern Mexico.[[7]](#cite_note-7) Kendall was a correspondent and saw the [Battle of Molino del Rey](/wiki/Battle_of_Molino_del_Rey \"Battle of Molino del Rey\"), but Nebel was not. The battle is often not depicted in contemporary illustrations, but Nebel did two different views of it.[[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\nGallery\n-------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Carl_Nebel&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Gallery\")]\n\n* [![Las Tortilleras, published 1836](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Tortilleras_Nebel.jpg/120px-Tortilleras_Nebel.jpg)](/wiki/File:Tortilleras_Nebel.jpg \"Las Tortilleras, published 1836\")\n  *Las Tortilleras*, published 1836\n* [![Sierra Indians, published 1836](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Nebel_Voyage_41_Indias_de_la_Sierra.jpg/120px-Nebel_Voyage_41_Indias_de_la_Sierra.jpg)](/wiki/File:Nebel_Voyage_41_Indias_de_la_Sierra.jpg \"Sierra Indians, published 1836\")\n  Sierra ",
