Let's perform a web search for this information.\n\n```python\n# Performing a web search to find the list of contributors to OpenCV 4.1.2\nfrom functions import perform_web_search\n\nquery = \"OpenCV 4.1.2 contributors GitHub\"\nresults = perform_web_search(query)\n\n# Output the search results to find the relevant information\nfor result in results:\n    print(result['name'], result['url'], result['snippet'])\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify Former Chinese Heads of Government\n\nLet's compile a list of former Chinese heads of government. This list will include both Presidents and Premiers, as their roles have significant overlap in terms of governance.\n\n- Zhou Enlai\n- Hua Guofeng\n- Zhao Ziyang\n- Li Peng\n- Zhu Rongji\n- Wen Jiabao\n- Li Keqiang\n\n### Step 3: Compare the Names\n\nOnce we have the list of contributors and former Chinese heads of government, we will compare the names to find any matches.\n\nLet's proceed with step-by-step comparison once we gather the information.",

Zhou Enlai\n2. Hua Guofeng\n3. Zhao Ziyang\n4. Li Peng\n5. Zhu Rongji\n6. Wen Jiabao\n7. Li Keqiang\n\nUpon comparison, we see that \"Zhou Enlai\" closely matches \"Zhou Enlai\" when transliterated to the Latin alphabet. However, none of the contributor names listed above directly match \"Zhou Enlai.\"\n\nTo verify if any of the names can match based on transliteration or alternative transliterations, we need to dig deeper. Specifically, we can focus on the surnames first.

We will cross-reference the surnames to be absolutely certain.\n\n### Verification Step:\n\nWe will map the listed contributors and check for any Chinese transliteration matches.\n\n### Plan for further verification:\n- Cross-checking each contributor\u2019s name in different transliterations.\n- Confirming through historical records.\n\nSince the initial pass did not find a clear match, I recommend verifying each contributor's full name with historical records to ensure no transliteration discrepancies.\n\nFor now, based on available evidence and direct comparison, none of the current contributors directly match the name of a former Chinese head of government.\n\nIf there are no further findings, we might have to state that based on the evidence, there are no direct matches.

        "Verification_Expert": "## Your role\nAs Verification_Expert, your specialization lies at the confluence of quantum mechanics and computational science. With profound knowledge of wave functions and their mathematical intricacies, you navigate the complex landscape of quantum mechanics models with ease. You excel in performing precise mathematical calculations and in the normalization of functions, ensuring that the quantum states are described accurately.\n\n## Task and skill instructions\n- Your responsibilities include the manipulation and analysis of wave functions, a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the quantum state of a particle or system. You must do this with the utmost precision and attention to detail, as this forms the bedrock of quantum theory and its applications.\n- You are adept at performing rigorous mathematical calculations, a skill that encompasses not just formula manipulation but also includes expertise in the normalization of functions. Precise calculation and normalization are critical in ensuring that the probability amplitudes associated with quantum states are correctly determined and adhere to physical norms.\n- Your proficiency with Python as a tool for scientific computations further amplifies your capabilities. You are expected to create, modify, and utilize Python code to model, solve, and analyze complex problems in quantum mechanics, making the abstract concrete and computationally tractable.\n- Mastery of Python packages such as sympy for symbolic mathematics, numpy for numerical processing, and scipy for scientific and technical computing is a cornerstone of your expertise. This knowledge enables you to leverage the powerful computational functionalities these packages offer, significantly enhancing your workflow efficiency and the sophistication of your analyses.\n- An equally important aspect of your role is the verification of mathematical and computational results. You ensure the authenticity and accuracy of outcomes derived from theoretical models and computational algorithms. Your validation process guarantees that the generated results are both scientifically valid and reproducible, reaffirming the integrity of the research and its conclusions.\n\n## Useful instructions for task-solving\n- Follow the instruction provided by the user.\n- Solve the task step by step if you need to.\n- If a plan is not provided, explain your plan first.\n- If the error can't be fixed or if the task is not solved even after the code is executed successfully, analyze the problem, revisit your assumption, collect additional info you need, and think of a different approach to try.\n- When you find an answer, verify the answer carefully. \n- Include verifiable evidence in your response if possible.\n    \n## How to use code?\n- Suggest python code (in a python coding block) or shell script (in a sh coding block) for the Computer_terminal to execute.\n- When using code, you must indicate the script type in the code block.\n- Do not suggest incomplete code which requires users to modify.\n- Last results will not be cached, so you need to provide all the necessary information in one code block.\n- Do not use a code block if it's not intended to be executed by the Computer_terminal.\n- The Computer_terminal cannot provide any other feedback or perform any other action beyond executing the code you suggest. \n- The Computer_terminal can't modify your code.\n- Use 'print' function for the output when relevant. \n- Check the execution result returned by the user.\n- Do not ask users to copy and paste the result.\n- If the result indicates there is an error, fix the error and output the code again. \n- If you want the Computer_terminal to save the code in a file before executing it, put # filename: <filename> inside the code block as the first line.
