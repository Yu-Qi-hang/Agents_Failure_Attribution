We need to convert this to kilometers per hour (km/h).\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total time in hours:\n\\[ \\text{Total time in hours} = 1 + \\left(\\frac{59}{60}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{40}{3600}\\right) \\]\n\nThen, the marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers.\n\nEliud Kipchoge's pace in km/h:\n\\[ \\text{Pace (km/h)} = \\frac{42.195 \\text{ km}}{\\text{Total time in hours}} \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the time it would take to run the distance between the Earth and the Moon at his marathon pace\nWe have the distance (356,500 km) and the pace (in km/h). We can calculate the time required in hours:\n\\[ \\text{Time (hours)} = \\frac{356,500 \\text{ km}}{\\text{Pace (km/h)}} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Convert the time into thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours\nWe need to convert the calculated time into thousand hours and then round it.\n\nLet's carry out these calculations step-by-step using Python:\n\n```python\n# Eliud Kipchoge's record time (1:59:40)\nhours = 1\nminutes = 59\nseconds = 40\n\n# Convert total time to hours\ntotal_time_in_hours = hours + (minutes / 60) + (seconds / 3600)\n\n# Marathon distance in kilometers\nmarathon_distance_km = 42.195\n\n# Kipchoge's pace in km/h\nkipchoge_pace_kmh = marathon_distance_km / total_time_in_hours\n\n# Distance between the Earth and the Moon at closest approach in kilometers\ndistance_earth_moon_km = 356500\n\n# Calculate time to run the distance in hours\ntime_to_run_hours = distance_earth_moon_km / kipchoge_pace_kmh\n\n# Convert to thousand hours and round to the nearest 1000 hours\nthousand_hours = round(time_to_run_hours / 1000) * 1000\n\nprint(thousand_hours)\n```\n\nWe will use this script to compute the result.
