This includes:\n     - Blue center (1 piece)\n     - Blue edges (8 pieces, with 2 colors)\n     - Blue corners (4 pieces, with 3 colors)\n   - All cubes directly left, right, above, and below the orange center cube have been found, along with the center cube. This includes:\n     - Orange center (1 piece)\n     - Orange edges adjacent to the center (4 pieces, with 2 colors)\n   - All green corners have been found (4 pieces with 3 colors)\n   - All green that borders yellow has been found. This includes:\n     - Green-yellow edges (4 pieces with 2 colors)\n   - For all orange cubes found, the opposite face’s cubes have been found. Therefore, the following opposite face pieces are found:\n     - Red edges opposite to the found orange edges\n\nGiven these pieces of information, we need to deduce which two-colored cube is missing. \n\n- Let's consider the position of pieces found:\n  - Blue center and all pieces involving blue\n  - Orange center and adjacent pieces\n  - Green corners and green-yellow edges\n\n**Analysis of Missing Cube:**\n- The missing cube is an edge piece (2 colors).\n- Since all blue and green pieces with their adjacent cubes have been found, and considering the condition of the removed piece being two-colored, it cannot involve blue or green.\n- Let’s look at other pairs: \n  - Yellow edges must also be considered due to the green corners bordering yellow.\n\nThe pieces that satisfy the condition are mostly focused on edge pieces involving red and white, since these are opposite to yellow/orange and not involved in constraints mentioned:\n\nTherefore, after careful evaluation, the only two-colored piece fitting constraints and missing is: **Red-White**.\n\nThe answer in alphabetical order is:\n```Red, White```",
