Let's search for the June 2022 paper on AI regulation in arXiv and locate the figure with three axes. We will extract the label words from this figure.\n\nAfter obtaining the label words, we need to check the Physics and Society article submitted to arXiv.org on August 11, 2016, to determine if any of the label words are used to describe a type of society in that article.\n\nLet's proceed step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Locate the June 2022 AI regulation paper and identify the figure with three axes\nI'll search for the June 2022 AI regulation paper on arXiv using appropriate queries.\n\n```python\nfrom functions import arxiv_search\n\n# Searching for papers on AI regulation submitted in June 2022\nquery = \"AI regulation\"\nmax_results = 10\nsearch_results = arxiv_search(query, max_results=max_results, sortby='submittedDate')\n\n# Filter results to find the paper submitted in June 2022\njune_2022_paper = None\nfor result in search_results:\n    if \"2022-06\" in result['published']:\n        june_2022_paper = result\n        break\n\n# Display information about the paper\njune_2022_paper\n```\n\nOnce we find the relevant paper, we will inspect its contents to locate the figure with three axes and extract the label words.\n\n### Step 2: Extract label words from the figure in the June 2022 paper\nWe will need to download the paper and look at its figures. For this, I will provide code to download the paper.\n\n```python\nfrom functions import arxiv_download\n\n# Download the PDF of the June 2022 paper\npaper_id = june_2022_paper['entry_id'].split('/')[-1]\ndownload_dir = './downloads'\ndownloaded_files = arxiv_download([paper_id], download_dir=download_dir)\n\n# Display the path to the downloaded file\ndownloaded_files\n```\n\nWe'll manually inspect the downloaded PDF to locate the figure with three axes and extract the label words at both ends of each axis.\n\n### Step 3: Check the August 2016 Physics and Society article for any of these label words\nAfter obtaining the label words from the June 2022 paper, I will search the August 2016 Physics and Society article for these words.\n\n```python\n# Searching for the Physics and Society article submitted in August 2016\nquery = \"Physics and Society\"\nsearch_results = arxiv_search(query, max_results=max_results, sortby='submittedDate')\n\n# Filter results to find the paper submitted on August 11, 2016\naug_2016_paper = None\nfor result in search_results:\n    if result['published'] == \"2016-08\":\n        aug_2016_paper = result\n        break\n\n# Display information about the paper\naug_2016_paper\n```\n\nWe'll download the August 2016 paper and check for the extracted label words to see which one describes a type of society.\n\n```python\n# Download the PDF of the August 2016 paper\npaper_id = aug_2016_paper['entry_id'].split('/')[-1]\ndownloaded_files = arxiv_download([paper_id], download_dir=download_dir)\n\n# Display the path to the downloaded file\ndownloaded_files\n```\n\nWe'll manually inspect the downloaded PDF to determine which label word describes a type of society.\n\n### Final Step: Verify and Conclude\nThe checker will verify the accuracy and consistency of the findings, ensuring the extracted label words are correct and the word describing a type of society matches one of these labels.\n\nBy following this plan, we should be able to identify the required information accurately.
