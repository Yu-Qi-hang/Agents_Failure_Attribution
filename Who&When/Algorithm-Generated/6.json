Analyze the article to verify the word quoted from two different authors in distaste for the nature of dragon depictions.\n\nLet us start with confirming the journal name \"Fafnir\" based on Hreidmar's sons. Hreidmar, a figure in Norse mythology, had three sons: Fafnir, Otr, and Regin. Fafnir is a well-known dragon in Norse mythology.\n\nNext, we will locate the specific article by Emily Midkiff in the June 2014 issue of the journal \"Fafnir.\" To do this, I will search for the article in an appropriate database.\n\nTo search for the article, I'll use the provided `arxiv_search` function. However, if \"Fafnir\" is not covered by the arXiv database, we may need to use a different source or verify manually. \n\nI'll start with the function and we can see if it yields any useful results:\n\n```python\nfrom functions import arxiv_search\n\n# Search query to find Emily Midkiff's June 2014 article in the journal \"Fafnir.\"\nquery = \"Emily Midkiff June 2014 Fafnir\"\nresults = arxiv_search(query, max_results=5, sortby='relevance')\nprint(results)\n```\n\nLet's see if this search brings up the necessary article.",

The program\\nobservations were made during a total of 72 apparitions between 2005-2021, and\\nare reported here along with several earlier unpublished lightcurves. All of\\nthe reported data were analyzed together with previously published lightcurves\\nto determine the objects' sidereal rotation periods, spin vector orientations,\\nand convex model shape solutions. The derived distributions of retrograde\\nrotation rates and pole obliquities appear to be qualitatively consistent with\\noutcomes of modification by thermal YORP torques. The distribution of spin\\nrates for the prograde rotators remains narrower than that for the retrograde\\nrotators; in particular, the absence of prograde rotators having periods longer\\nthan about 20 h is real, while among the retrograde rotators are several\\nobjects having longer periods up to about 65 h. None of the prograde objects\\nnewly added to the sample appear to be trapped in an $s_6$ spin-orbit resonance\\nthat is characteristic of most of the largest prograde objects; these smaller\\nobjects either could have been trapped previously and have already evolved out,\\nor have experienced spin evolution tracks that did not include the resonance.\", 'entry_id': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12355v1', 'doi': '10.1016/S0019-1035(22)00489-4 10.1016/j.icarus.2022.115397', 'published': '2022-12'}, {'title': 'Proceedings of The 38th Annual Workshop of the Austrian Association for Pattern Recognition (\u00d6AGM), 2014', 'authors': 'Vladimir Kolmogorov, Christoph Lampert, Emilie Morvant, Rustem Takhanov', 'summary': 'The 38th Annual Workshop of the Austrian Association for Pattern Recognition\\n(\\\\\"OAGM) will be held at IST Austria, on May 22-23, 2014.
