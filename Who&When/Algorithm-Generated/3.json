Extract the red and green numbers from the image.\n2. Calculate the standard population deviation of the red numbers.\n3. Calculate the standard sample deviation of the green numbers.\n4. Compute the average of the two deviations.\n5. Round the result to the nearest three decimal points.\n\n## Output format\nThe result should be a single floating-point number rounded to three decimal points.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The calculations must be done using the statistics module in Python 3.11.\n- The result must be accurate and verified by the checker.\n- The image path is ../2023/validation/df6561b2-7ee5-4540-baab-5095f742716a.png.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe task was not completed due to multiple hurdles in extracting the required numbers from the image. Specifically, the installation of Tesseract OCR and associated libraries took too long, and alternative methods also failed.\n\n## Reason for the results\n1. Tesseract OCR not installed: Initial attempts to extract text from the image failed because Tesseract OCR was not installed or not in the PATH.\n2. Timeout errors: Subsequent attempts to install Tesseract OCR using `sudo apt-get` commands repeatedly timed out.\n3. Dependency issues: Even with alternative extraction methods using OpenCV, the lack of Tesseract OCR still impeded progress, as shown by the final `NameError` for `pytesseract`.\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n- The installation of essential software (Tesseract OCR) repeatedly timed out.\n- Alternative approaches continued to rely on Tesseract OCR, which was not installed.\n- The final code attempt still included a reference to `pytesseract`, which was unavailable, resulting in a `NameError`.
