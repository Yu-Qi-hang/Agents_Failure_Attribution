In Western cultures, dragons are typically depicted as large, winged, fire-breathing serpents with horns.

They are often associated with chaotic or destructive natural forces, like droughts or floods, and are depicted in legends involving heroic figures or deities.

On Wikipedia, these are:\n\n* Find addition/removal calls a tool called [WikiBlame](/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiBlame \"Wikipedia:WikiBlame\"), which searches page histories (not the body of pages) for [strings](/wiki/String_(computer_science) \"String (computer science)\"), reporting which user(s) were responsible for adding or deleting the string.\n* Find edits by user.\n* Page statistics gives word, character, and link counts, top editors, and edit counts by month and year. \"Page information\", in every page's left-hand margin, gives highlights of this information.\n* Page views over any time period selected. \"Page information\", in the left-hand margin, gives page views for the previous 30 days only.\n* Fix dead links. Dead links will be repaired if the page linked has been archived in the [Internet Archive](/wiki/Internet_Archive \"Internet Archive\"). Repairs will generate an entry in the \"page history\".\n  + On the dead links tool, there is a box which, if checked, will cause the tool to back up in the Internet Archive those linked pages not yet in it. This is not needed (and is sometimes blocked) for major sources like [*The New York Times*](/wiki/The_New_York_Times \"The New York Times\"), but is valuable for pages which are more likely to go dead, such as personal pages and those from small businesses and small or temporary organizations.\n\nUsing a history page\n--------------------\n\n### Overview\n\nOn a history page:\n\n* All past changes to the page in question are listed in reverse-chronological order.\n* To view a specific revision, click a date.\n* To compare an old revision with the current revision, go to the old revision, click **cur**.\n* To compare a revision with its predecessor, \n\nAddress: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year\nTitle: Leap year - Wikipedia\nViewport position: Showing page 1 of 17.\n=======================\n# Leap year\n\nCalendar year containing an additional day\nFor other uses, see [Leap year (disambiguation)](/wiki/Leap_year_(disambiguation) \"Leap year (disambiguation)\").\n\nA **leap year** (also known as an **intercalary year** or **bissextile year**) is a [calendar year](/wiki/Calendar_year \"Calendar year\") that contains an additional day (or, in the case of a [lunisolar calendar](/wiki/Lunisolar_calendar \"Lunisolar calendar\"), a month) compared to a [common year](/wiki/Common_year \"Common year\"). The 366th day (or 13th month) is added to keep the calendar year synchronised with the [astronomical year](/wiki/Astronomical_year \"Astronomical year\") or [seasonal year](/wiki/Seasonal_year \"Seasonal year\").[[1]](#cite_note-Meeus-1) Since astronomical events and seasons do not repeat in a [whole number](/wiki/Natural_number \"Natural number\") of days, calendars having a constant number of days each year will unavoidably drift over time with respect to the event that the year is supposed to track, such as seasons. By inserting (\"[intercalating](/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) \"Intercalation (timekeeping)\")\") an additional day—a **leap day**—or month—a **[leap month](/wiki/Leap_month \"Leap month\")**—into some years, the drift between a civilization's dating system and the physical properties of the [Solar System](/wiki/Solar_System \"Solar System\") can be corrected.\n\nAn astronomical year lasts slightly less than 365⁠1/4⁠ days. The historic [Julian calendar](/wiki/Julian_calendar \"Julian calendar\") has three [common years](/wiki/Common_year \"Common year\") of 365 days followed by a leap year of 366 days, by extending February to 29 days rather than the common 28. The [Gregorian calendar](/wiki/Gregorian_calendar \"Gregorian calendar\"), the world's most widely used civil calendar, makes a further adjustment for the small error in the Julian algorithm. Each leap year has 366 days instead of 365. This extra leap day occurs in each year that is a multiple of 4, except for years evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400.\n\nIn the lunisolar [Hebrew calendar](/wiki/Hebrew_calendar \"Hebrew calendar\"), [Adar Aleph](/wiki/Adar_1 \"Adar 1\"), a 13th [lunar month](/wiki/Lunar_month \"Lunar month\"), is added seven times every 19 years to the twelve lunar months in its common years to keep its calendar year from drifting through the seasons. In the [Solar Hijri](/wiki/Solar_Hijri_calendar \"Solar Hijri calendar\") and [Bahá'í calendars](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_calendar \"Bahá'í calendar\"), a leap day is added when needed to ensure that the following year begins on the [March equinox](/wiki/March_equinox \"March equinox\").\n\nThe term *leap year* probably comes from the fact that a fixed date in the Gregorian calendar normally advances one day of the week from one year to the next, but the day of the week in the 12 months following the leap day (from 1 March through 28 February of the following year) will advance two days due to the extra day, thus leaping over one day in the week.[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) For example, 1 March was on a Friday in 2024, then it will be on Saturday in 2025, Sunday in 2026, and Monday in 2027, but then will \"leap\" over Tuesday to fall on a Wednesday in 2028.\n\nThe length of a day is also occasionally corrected by inserting a [leap second](/wiki/Leap_second \"Leap second\") into [Coordinated Universal Time](/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time \"Coordinated Universal Time\") (UTC) because of variations in Earth's [rotation period](/wiki/Rotation_period \"Rotation period\"). Unlike leap days, leap seconds are not introduced on a regular schedule because variations in the length of the day are not entirely predictable.\n\nLeap years can present a problem in computing, known as the [leap year bug](/wiki/Leap_year_bug \"Leap year bug\"), when a year is not correctly identified as a leap year or when 29 February is not handled correctly in logic that accepts or manipulates dates.\n\nJulian calendar\n---------------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Leap_year&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Julian calendar\")]\nMain article: [Julian calendar](/wiki/Julian_calendar \"Julian calendar\")\n\nOn 1 January 45 BC, by edict, [Julius Caesar](/wiki/Julius_Caesar \"Julius Caesar\") reformed the historic [Roman calendar](/wiki/Roman_calendar \"Roman calendar\") to make it a consistent [solar calendar](/wiki/Solar_calendar \"Solar calendar\") (rather than one which was neither strictly lunar nor strictly solar), thus removing the need for frequent [intercalary months](/wiki/Intercalation_(timekeeping) \"Intercalation (timekeeping)\"). His rule for leap years was a simple one: add a leap day every 4 years. This algorithm is close to reality: a Julian year lasts 365.25 days, a [mean tropical year](/wiki/Mean_tropical_year \"Mean tropical year\") about 365.2422 days.[[4]](#cite_note-4) Consequently, even this Julian calendar drifts out of 'true' by about 3 days every 400 years. The Julian calendar continued in use unaltered for about 1600 years until the Catholic Church became concerned about the widening divergence between the [March Equinox](/wiki/March_Equinox \"March Equinox\") ",
