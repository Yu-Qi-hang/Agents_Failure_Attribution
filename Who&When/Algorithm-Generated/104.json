Checking the general structure of your script.\n2. Ensuring that all necessary packages are installed and correctly imported.\n3. Verifying that there are no syntax errors.\n\nSince we don't have the specific code, let's create a general debug template to cover various potential issues. Once we have this template, you can adapt it to your specific code to find the underlying problem.\n\nPlease run the following Python script to check for basic issues:\n\n```python\n# filename: debug_template.py\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    try:\n        # Simulating a simple Python script structure\n        print(\"Script started\")\n        \n        # Add your code here\n        # For example:\n        # import necessary libraries\n        # process data or perform operations\n        \n        print(\"Script executed successfully\")\n        sys.exit(0)\n    except SyntaxError as e:\n        print(f\"Syntax Error: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    except ImportError as e:\n        print(f\"Import Error: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis script sets up a basic structure for error handling and allows you to insert your code in the designated area. By running this template, we can catch various errors such as syntax errors, import errors, and other exceptions.\n\nPlease adapt your specific code into this structure, run it, and provide the output.
