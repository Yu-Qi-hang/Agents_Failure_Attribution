There\u2019s a certain species of fish that was popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo. According to the USGS, where was this fish found as a nonnative species, before the year 2020? I need the answer formatted as the five-digit zip codes of the places the species was found, separated by commas if there is more than one place. Please solve the problem carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nResearch the species of fish popularized as a pet by being the main character of the movie Finding Nemo and determine where it was found as a nonnative species according to the USGS, before the year 2020.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Verify the species of fish from the movie Finding Nemo.\n2. Recheck the USGS database to find records of this species being found as a nonnative species before the year 2020.\n3. Extract the zip codes of the locations where the species was found.\n4. Format the zip codes as a comma-separated list.\n\n## Output format\nA comma-separated list of five-digit zip codes where the species was found as a nonnative species before the year 2020.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The species must be identified correctly.\n- The data must be sourced from the USGS database.\n- Only records before the year 2020 should be considered.\n- The output must be formatted correctly as a comma-separated list of five-digit zip codes.\n\n## Results from last response\nZip codes where Amphiprion ocellaris was found as a nonnative species before 2020:\n**33040, 33037**\n\n## Reason for the results\nThe initial task was to identify the species of the main character in the movie \"Finding Nemo,\" which was determined to be Amphiprion ocellaris (Ocellaris clownfish). After identifying the species, the next step involved searching for locations where it was found as a nonnative species using the USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species database. The search pointed to Florida zip codes 33040 (Key West) and 33037 (Key Largo).\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. Although web search results were returned, the conversation did not provide direct access to the evidence from USGS links; assumed synthesis from search results pointed out the zip codes. The final verification step was initiated but halted due to a lack of response coordination.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\n- Links to USGS website:\n  - [Clown Anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Species Profile](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/FactSheet.aspx?SpeciesID=3243)\n  - [Species Profile - Amphiprion ocellaris - Nonindigenous Aquatic Species](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/queries/GreatLakes/FactSheet.aspx?SpeciesID=3243)\n  - [Clown Anemonefish (Amphiprion ocellaris) - Nonindigenous Aquatic Species](https://nas.er.usgs.gov/viewer/omap.aspx?SpeciesID=3243) ",
