Verify and confirm the population data.\n\nSince accessing Wikipedia as of January 1, 2021, directly is not feasible through this chat, I will consider other reliable methods like using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine to fetch the Wikipedia page as of the specific date.\n\n### Step-by-Step Verification:\n\n1. **Access the Wikipedia Page:**\n   - Go to the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/web/).\n   - Enter the URL for the Wikipedia page of Greenland: `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenland`.\n   - Select a snapshot as close to January 1, 2021, as possible.\n\n2. **Locate the Population Data:**\n   - Search for the section regarding the population of Greenland in 2020 on the captured Wikipedia page.\n   - Record the estimated population data provided.\n\nLet's first navigate to the Wayback Machine and retrieve the necessary historical snapshot.\n\n---\n\nIf we assume that obtaining this information directly from the Wayback Machine shows the population estimate, we can confirm the result accordingly. Let’s proceed with that step.\n\nPlease note: Manual verification by accessing the historical Wikipedia page through the Wayback Machine will confirm the accuracy. If you have any prior information or screenshots, please provide them for accurate verification.\n\nOnce the data is obtained, I will round the population estimate to the nearest thousand as requested.\n\nIf any team member has access to the historical data or has additional insights, please contribute.",
