You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells.

Please solve the problem carefully.The attached file path is: ../2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nYou are given an Excel file as a map. You start on the START cell and move toward the END cell. You are allowed to move two cells per turn, and you may move up, down, left, or right. You may not move fewer than two cells, and you may not move backward. You must avoid moving onto any blue cells. On the eleventh turn, what is the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving?\nThe attached file path is: ../2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx.\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Load the Excel file and identify the START and END cells.\n2. Develop a pathfinding algorithm that adheres to the movement constraints (two cells per turn, no backward movement, avoid blue cells).\n3. Execute the pathfinding algorithm and track the cell landed on after each turn.\n4. Identify the color of the cell landed on after the eleventh turn.\n5. Convert the color to a 6-digit hex code.\n\n## Output format\nProvide the 6-digit hex code (without prefix) of the color of the cell where you land after moving on the eleventh turn.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- The path must avoid blue cells.\n- Movement must be exactly two cells per turn.\n- No backward movement is allowed.\n- The task must be completed within the constraints of the Excel file provided.\n\n## Results and reason from last response\nThe final position after 11 turns is identified successfully as (14, 8). However, the task remains incomplete because code execution failed when attempting to retrieve the color from the final position.\n\nThe task progresses correctly through loading the Excel file, identifying the START and END cells, and implementing the pathfinding algorithm that calculates the final position after 11 moves. However, coding errors related to variable scope and function depreciation prevented the successful retrieval and conversion of the color code.\n\nErrors or issues in the conversation\n1. The initial attempts failed to locate the START cell due to issues in handling Excel data format and variable scoping.\n2. Function depreciation warnings (use of `applymap`) were not addressed for future-proofing.\n3. Final attempts to execute the code did not ensure proper visibility/scope of the `sheet_data` variable, leading to repeated NameError.\n4. No alternative strategy was explored to address the lack of color data in the final position and adjacent cells if avoiding errors and re-checking didn't help.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\n- File path: `../2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx`\n- Correct code snippets for handling Excel file and alternative verification:\n  ```python\n  import pandas as pd\n  \n  file_path = '../2023/validation/65afbc8a-89ca-4ad5-8d62-355bb401f61d.xlsx'\n  sheet_data = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name='Sheet1', header=None)\n  ```\n\n  ```python\n  from collections import deque\n\n  directions = [(0, 2), (2, 0), (0, -2), (-2, 0)]\n  def is_valid_move(x, y, sheet_data):\n      return 0 <= x < sheet_data.shape[0] and 0 <= y < sheet_data.shape[1] and sheet_data.iloc[x, y] != 'blue'\n\n  def bfs(start, turns, sheet_data):\n      queue = deque([(start, [])])\n      visited = set([start])\n      \n      while queue:\n          (x, y), path = queue.popleft()\n          if len(path) == turns:\n              return path\n          for dx, dy in directions:\n              nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n              if is_valid_move(nx, ny, sheet_data) and (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                  visited.add((nx, ny))\n                  queue.append(((nx, ny), path + [(nx, ny)]))\n\n  start_loc = (0, 0)\n  path_after_11_turns = bfs(start_loc, 11, sheet_data)\n  ```\n\n  ```python\n  final_position = (14, 8)\n  final_color = sheet_data.iloc[final_position[0], final_position[1]]\n  if pd.isna(final_color) or final_color == '':\n      print(\"The cell does not contain color information.\")\n  else:\n      import matplotlib.colors as mcolors\n      def convert_to_hex(color_value):\n          if isinstance(color_value, str) and color_value.startswith('#'):\n              return color_value[1:]\n          raise ValueError(\"Unsupported color format\")\n      final_hex_code = convert_to_hex(final_color)\n      print(\"Final hex code:\", final_hex_code)\n  ```\n\n  ```python\n  # To check final position and adjacent cells for color information\n  def check_adjacent_cells(final_position, sheet_data):\n      adjacent_positions = [(final_position[0] + dx, final_position[1] + dy) for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]]\n      for pos in adjacent_positions:\n          if 0 <= pos[0] < sheet_data.shape[0] and 0 <= pos[1] < sheet_data.shape[1]:\n              cell_color = sheet_data.iloc[pos[0], pos[1]]\n              if pd.notna(cell_color) and cell_color != '':\n                  print(f\"Color found at {pos}: {cell_color}\")\n                  return cell_color\n      return None\n  ``` ",
