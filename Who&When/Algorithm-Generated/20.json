Wikimedia API requests are rate limited based on client ID, so you should create one set of credentials per app. To create credentials, select an app type, and provide a redirect URL.\n\n* **Name**: Choose a unique name to help identify your app.\n* **Description**: Admins use this field to evaluate your client, so include a description of how your app uses Wikimedia content.\n* **Redirect URI** is used by the OAuth authentication server to return users to your app after approval.\n\nApp credentials with edit permissions must be approved by Wikimedia OAuth administrators before they can be used. You can see the status of your client on the [API keys dashboard](/wiki/Special:AppManagement \"Special:AppManagement\"). Once your app is approved, you'll receive an email from wiki@wikimedia.org.\n\n### Create a personal API token\n\nA personal API token is tied to your Wikimedia account. It should only be used by you and should not be published or shared. To create a personal API token, select the **API token** key type. After submitting the form, you'll be shown a client ID, client secret, and access token. Remember to store your access token in a secure place; you won't be able to access it again through the API Portal. Personal API tokens are approved automatically.\n\nKey status\n----------\n\nThe [API keys dashboard](/wiki/Special:AppManagement \"Special:AppManagement\") displays the status of each key.\n\n* **Approved** keys are ready to use.\n* **Approval pending** keys are waiting for review and approval by Wikimedia OAuth admins. Approval usually occurs within two weeks.\n* **Rejected** keys have been rejected by Wikimedia OAuth admins. This is usually due to security concerns or missing or unclear information. If your key is rejected, you should receive an email from wiki@wikimedia.org with the rejection reason and steps to re-submit your key.\n* **Expired** keys have not been approved within 30 days. If your key is expired, please re-create the key.\n* **Disabled** keys have been disabled by Wikimedia OAuth admins due to security concerns or risky behavior.\n\nReset secrets\n-------------\n\nTo reset a client secret, select **View details** for the key on the [API keys dashboard](/wiki/Special:AppManagement \"Special:AppManagement\"), and select **Reset client secret**. This resets all provided secrets for the key, including a personal API token. Resetting a secret does not invalidate existing secrets.\n\n  \n\n  \n\n![](https://login.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=0)\nRetrieved from \"<https://api.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Managing_API_keys&oldid=1865>\"\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, Inc is a nonprofit charitable organization dedicated to encouraging the growth, development and distribution of free, multilingual content, and to providing the full content of these wiki-based projects to the public free of charge.\n\n[Contact](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/contact/)\n[About Wikimedia](https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/)\n\n### Wikimedia Projects\n\n[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)[Wikibooks](https://www.wikibooks.org/)[Wikiversity](https://www.wikiversity.org/)[Wikinews](https://www.wikinews.org/)[Wiktionary](https://www.wiktionary.org/)[Wikisource](https://www.wikisource.org/)[Wikiquote](https://www.wikiquote.org/)[Wikivoyage](https://www.wikivoyage.org/)[Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/)[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/)[Wikispecies](https://species.wikimedia.org/)[MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/)\n\n### Movement affiliates\n\n[Wikimedia Chapters](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_chapters)[Wikimedia Thematic Organizations](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_thematic_organizations)[Wikimedia User Groups](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_user_groups)\n\n### OTHER\n\n[Terms of use](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Terms_of_Use)[Privacy policy](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:Privacy_policy)[Disclaimers](https://foundation.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Policy:General_disclaimer)[Accessibility ",

The Church's status has been maintained in England, but in Ireland, [the Anglican Church of Ireland](/wiki/Church_of_Ireland \"Church of Ireland\") was disestablished in 1871. In Wales, four Church of England [dioceses](/wiki/Diocese \"Diocese\") were disestablished in 1920 and became the [Church in Wales](/wiki/Church_in_Wales \"Church in Wales\"). In colonial America, the Church of England was disestablished in six colonies despite its mild popularity in the 1780s; many Anglicans in America began to refer to themselves as [Episcopalians](/wiki/Episcopal_Church_(United_States) \"Episcopal Church (United States)\").[[3]](#cite_note-3)\n\n*Antidisestablishmentarianism* is also frequently noted as one of the [longest non-scientific words](/wiki/Antidisestablishmentarianism_(word) \"Antidisestablishmentarianism (word)\") in the English language.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Antidisestablishmentarianism&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: History\")]\n\nThe matter of disestablishment of the Church of England is an ongoing issue, often tied with the position of the [Monarchy of the United Kingdom](/wiki/English_monarch \"English monarch\") as [\"Supreme Governor\" of the Church](/wiki/Supreme_Governor_of_the_Church_of_England \"Supreme Governor of the Church of England\") (see [Act of Settlement 1701](/wiki/Act_of_Settlement_1701 \"Act of Settlement 1701\")).\n\nBritish philosopher [Phillip Blond](/wiki/Phillip_Blond \"Phillip Blond\"), an advocate of the antidisestablishmentarian position, argues that England's having a state church has prevented the country from embracing any sort of ethnic or racial nationalism.[[4]](#cite_note-Blond2010-4) Blond has stated that official patronage of the [Church of England](/wiki/Church_of_England \"Church of England\") has allowed the country to withstand and speak against totalitarian ideologies of the 20th century that were plaguing other parts of the world.[[4]](#cite_note-Blond2010-4) He further opined that \"Just as we need the church to protect the political, so we need it to protect the idea of civil society.\"[[4]](#cite_note-Blond2010-4) Blond concludes that the \"church establishment in England creates a more diverse political and social life, prevents religious extremism and helps to minimise partisan conflict and secular violence.\"[[4]](#cite_note-Blond2010-4) [Giles Coren](/wiki/Giles_Coren \"Giles Coren\"), a British writer, supports antidisestablishmentarianism because it allows all English people to receive meaningful [rites](/wiki/Rite_(Christianity) \"Rite (Christianity)\") such as marriage.[[5]](#cite_note-Corren2012-5)\n\nIn April 2014, [Nick Clegg](/wiki/Nick_Clegg \"Nick Clegg\"), then [Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom](/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\") and [Leader of the Liberal Democrats](/wiki/Leader_of_the_Liberal_Democrats \"Leader of the Liberal Democrats\"), said that he thought the Church of England and the British state should be separated \"in the long run\".[[6]](#cite_note-clegg-6) [David Cameron](/wiki/David_Cameron \"David Cameron\"), the [Prime Minister of the United Kingdom](/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom \"Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\") at the time, responded to Clegg's comments by stating that the position was \"a long-term Liberal idea, but it is not a [Conservative](/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) \"Conservative Party (UK)\") one\", adding that he believed the existence of an established church is beneficial.[[6]](#cite_note-clegg-6)\n\nWord ",

            "content": "Antidisestablishmentarianism is a political movement in the UK advocating for the continued government patronage of a state church, specifically opposing the separation of the Church of England from the state. This movement emerged in the 19th century in response to the Liberal Party's disestablishmentarian efforts to remove the Church of England's status as the official state church in England, Ireland, and Wales. While the Church's status was preserved in England, the Anglican Church of Ireland was disestablished in 1871 and the Church in Wales in 1920. Proponents like philosopher Phillip Blond argue that an established church has helped England resist nationalism and totalitarian ideologies, thus promoting a more diverse political and social life, while reducing religious extremism and secular violence.\n\nThe term \"antidisestablishmentarianism\" is often noted for its length, being one of the longest non-scientific words in the English language, consisting of 28 letters and 12 syllables. Despite its recognition in the Oxford dictionary, it is not listed in Merriam-Webster's dictionary of American English. The debate over the Church of England's establishment continues, with figures like Nick Clegg advocating for separation, while others, such as former Prime Minister David Cameron, believe in the benefits of maintaining the established church.",
