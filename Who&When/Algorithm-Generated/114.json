This entails checking the integrity and relevance of the dataset.\n2. **Verify the Function**: Ensure that the function used to find the smallest house with at least 2 beds and 2 baths in Prince Edward Island sold between June 1, 2022, and May 15, 2024, works correctly.\n\n### Part 1: Review the Sample Dataset\nTo review the sample dataset, we'll need to:\n- Load the sample dataset.\n- Examine its structure, including the columns and data types.\n- Verify that it contains relevant data for houses sold in Prince Edward Island within the specified date range.\n\n### Part 2: Verify the Function\nTo verify the function, we will:\n- Review the function's code.\n- Ensure it correctly filters houses based on the criteria.\n- Check that it identifies the smallest house based on square footage.\n\nLet's start by loading the sample dataset and examining its structure. We assume the sample dataset is provided in a CSV file. If not, we would need a sample CSV dataset.\n\n### Step 1: Load and Examine the Sample Dataset\n\nLet's create a Python script to load and examine the sample dataset.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the sample dataset\ncsv_file = 'sample_real_estate_data.csv'\n\n# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame\ndf = pd.read_csv(csv_file)\n\n# Display the first few rows and the column information\nprint(df.head())\nprint(df.info())\n```\n\n### Step 2: Verify the Function\n\nAssuming we have the function `find_smallest_house`, let's review its implementation. If the function is not provided, we'll create a sample function to find the smallest house based on the given criteria.\n\nHere's a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\ndef find_smallest_house(csv_file):\n    # Load the dataset\n    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)\n    \n    # Convert the date column to datetime\n    df['sale_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['sale_date'])\n    \n    # Filter the DataFrame based on the criteria\n    filtered_df = df[\n        (df['beds'] >= 2) & \n        (df['baths'] >= 2) & \n        (df['location'] == 'Prince Edward Island') & \n        (df['sale_date'] >= '2022-06-01') & \n        (df['sale_date'] <= '2024-05-15')\n    ]\n    \n    # Find the row with the smallest square footage\n    smallest_house = filtered_df.loc[filtered_df['square_footage'].idxmin()]\n    \n    return smallest_house\n\n# Verify the function using the sample dataset\nsmallest_house = find_smallest_house('sample_real_estate_data.csv')\nprint(smallest_house)\n```\n\nLet's integrate everything and run the complete verification script.\n\n```python\n# filename: verify_smallest_house.py\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef find_smallest_house(csv_file):\n    # Load the dataset\n    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file)\n    \n    # Convert the date column to datetime\n    df['sale_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['sale_date'])\n    \n    # Filter the DataFrame based on the criteria\n    filtered_df = df[\n        (df['beds'] >= 2) & \n        (df['baths'] >= 2) & \n        (df['location'] == 'Prince Edward Island') & \n        (df['sale_date'] >= '2022-06-01') & \n        (df['sale_date'] <= '2024-05-15')\n    ]\n    \n    # Find the row with the smallest square footage\n    smallest_house = filtered_df.loc[filtered_df['square_footage'].idxmin()]\n    \n    return smallest_house\n\n# Load and examine the sample dataset\ncsv_file = 'sample_real_estate_data.csv'\ndf = pd.read_csv(csv_file)\nprint(\"Dataset Preview:\\n\", df.head())\nprint(\"\\nDataset Info:\\n\")\ndf.info()\n\n# Verify the function using the sample dataset\nsmallest_house = find_smallest_house(csv_file)\nprint(\"\\nSmallest House Details:\\n\", smallest_house)\n```\n\nLet's run the integrated script to load the dataset, examine its structure, and verify the function.\n\n```sh\npython verify_smallest_house.py\n```",
