If the relevant table is identified, I'll then extract the names of winners.\n\nHere's the modified approach:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\n# Define the URL\nurl = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_(American_TV_series)\"\n\n# Fetch the page content\nresponse = requests.get(url)\nsoup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n# Find the relevant table containing winners information\ntables = soup.find_all('table', {'class': 'wikitable'})\n\n# List to store winners\nunique_survivor_winners = set()\n\n# Extract winners from the table\nfor table in tables:\n    rows = table.find_all('tr')\n    for row in rows:\n        cells = row.find_all('td')\n        if len(cells) > 0:\n            # Assume the winner's name is in the first column of the row\n            winner_name = cells[0].get_text(strip=True)\n            unique_survivor_winners.add(winner_name)\n\n# Get the count of unique winners\nunique_survivor_winners_count = len(unique_survivor_winners)\nprint(unique_survivor_winners_count)\n```\n\nLet's execute this code to ensure we correctly extract and count the unique winners of Survivor.",
