The Count's advisors have reported that a vampire was spotted crossing the border near the village, and would like you to investigate it.\n\nYou travel to the village of Șirnea, and you begin your investigation. One night, just before dawn, you catch a glimpse of a man in a long black cape with red lining leaping from roof-top to roof-top with superhuman agility. It's a vampire! You try to chase the creature back to its home, but the creature is too fast. However, because of the remoteness of the village, you know with absolute certainty that the vampire must be a resident of the village. You decide that your best course of action will be to visit all 100 residents of the town during the day. You know something about vampires and humans that will make your investigation possible; humans always tell the truth, but vampires always lie.\n\nIn the afternoon, you go from house to house, speaking with all 100 residents of Șirnea. You ask everyone the same question: \"How many vampires are living in Șirnea\". Everyone in the village gives the same response, \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\nHow many residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires?",

Each one responded with: \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n\n### Behavioral Analysis:\n1. **Humans Always Tell the Truth**:\n   - If a human says, \"At least one of us is a human,\" it must be true.\n   \n2. **Vampires Always Lie**:\n   - If a vampire says, \"At least one of us is a human,\" it must be false.\n\n### Logical Reasoning:\n- Let's analyze the consistency of the statements:\n\n  **Scenario 1: All residents are humans**:\n  - If all residents are humans, each human would be telling the truth by saying \"At least one of us is a human.\"\n  - This scenario is logically consistent.\n\n  **Scenario 2: Some residents are vampires**:\n  - If there is at least one vampire, then the statement \"At least one of us is a human\" made by vampires would be false, which contradicts the statement.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that each resident consistently says \"At least one of us is a human\", and knowing that vampires always lie, the only logical conclusion is that all residents must be humans. If there were any vampires, they would have lied and their statements would be inconsistent.\n\nThus, **none** of the residents of Șirnea have been turned into vampires. All 100 residents are humans.\n\n### Output\n- Number of residents who have been turned into vampires: **0**\n- Logical reasoning: If there were any vampires, they would have lied and made inconsistent statements. The consistent statements \"At least one of us is a human\" made by all residents confirm that all are humans.\n\nThe solution is logically consistent with the given behaviors of humans and vampires.",

This assumption is consistent with humans always telling the truth.\n\n2. **Assume some residents are vampires:**\n   - If at least one resident is a vampire, their statement \"At least one of us is a human\" must be false (since vampires lie).\n   - For this statement to be false, it would imply there are no humans, contradicting the assumption that some residents are vampires.\n   - Thus, it creates an inconsistency because vampires' statement cannot be false if there are humans.\n\n### Logical Consistency:\n- **All humans scenario:** True and consistent.\n- **Some vampires scenario:** Inconsistent due to false statements contradiction.\n\nThus, the only logically consistent scenario is that **all 100 residents are humans**.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nThe number of residents who have been turned into vampires is indeed **0**, with detailed logical reasoning as shown.\n\n### Output:\n- Number of residents who have been turned into vampires: **0**\n- Logical reasoning: Consistent statements \"At least one of us is a human\" confirm that all are humans, making any vampire presence logically inconsistent.\n\nIf everyone agrees with this reasoning and conclusion, we can proceed to terminate the task. \n\nPlease confirm your agreement.",
