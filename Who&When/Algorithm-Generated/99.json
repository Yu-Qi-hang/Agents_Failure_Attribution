            "content": "First, let's gather the necessary ticket pricing information for the Philadelphia Museum of Art. These can usually be found on the museum's website or by contacting the museum directly. \n\nAssuming we have the following pricing information (this is just an example and must be verified with actual data):\n\n- Daily ticket price for an adult: $25\n- Daily ticket price for a student: $14\n- Annual pass price for an adult: $100\n- Annual pass price for a student: $50\n\nNow, letâ€™s follow the steps outlined in the plan:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost for daily tickets:\n   - Total cost for 4 adults visiting 5 times: \\(4 \\text{ adults} \\times 5 \\text{ visits} \\times 25 \\text{ dollars} = 500 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Total cost for 1 student visiting 5 times: \\(1 \\text{ student} \\times 5 \\text{ visits} \\times 14 \\text{ dollars} = 70 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Total cost for daily tickets: \\(500 + 70 = 570 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\n2. Calculate the total cost for annual passes:\n   - Total cost for 4 adults with annual passes: \\(4 \\text{ adults} \\times 100 \\text{ dollars} = 400 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Total cost for 1 student with an annual pass: \\(1 \\text{ student} \\times 50 \\text{ dollars} = 50 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n   - Total cost for annual passes: \\(400 + 50 = 450 \\text{ dollars}\\)\n\n3.
