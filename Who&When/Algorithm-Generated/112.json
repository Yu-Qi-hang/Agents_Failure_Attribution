(Provide the answer in percentage.) Please solve the task carefully.\n\n# Task and suggestions from manager\n## Task description\nDetermine the likelihood that it will snow on New Year’s Eve in Chicago based on the last decade (2014-2023).\n\n## Plan for solving the task\n1. Collect historical weather data for Chicago from 2014 to 2023, specifically focusing on New Year’s Eve.\n2. Analyze the data to identify the number of times it snowed on New Year’s Eve during this period.\n3. Calculate the probability of snowfall on New Year’s Eve based on the historical data.\n4. Verify the accuracy of the data and calculations.\n\n## Output format\n- The probability of snowfall on New Year’s Eve in Chicago as a percentage.\n\n## Constraints and conditions for completion\n- Use accurate and reliable historical weather data.\n- Ensure the calculations are precise and verified.\n\n## Results from last response\nThe calculated probability of snowfall on New Year’s Eve in Chicago is 50.00%.\n\n## Reason for the results\nThe analysis was conducted using a mock dataset due to the unavailability of actual historical weather data. The mock data indicated that it snowed on 5 out of 10 New Year’s Eves between 2014 and 2023.\n\n## Errors or issues in the conversation\n1. The lack of access to actual historical weather data led to the use of a mock dataset, which may not accurately represent the true snowfall data.\n2. Attempts to read from a non-existent CSV file and fetch data from a non-configured API endpoint were both unsuccessful, primarily due to file not found errors and invalid URL schema, respectively.\n\n### Need to double-check?\nYes\n\n## Additional information (file path, code blocks, url, etc.)\nThe Python code snippets provided for fetching data from a CSV file and an API endpoint should be verified with actual data sources:\n1. **CSV File Code**:\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n\n   weather_data = pd.read_csv('chicago_weather_data.csv')\n   weather_data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(weather_data['Date'])\n   weather_data = weather_data[(weather_data['Date'].dt.month == 12) & (weather_data['Date'].dt.day == 31)]\n   weather_data = weather_data[(weather_data['Date'].dt.year >= 2014) & (weather_data['Date'].dt.year <= 2023)]\n\n   snowfall_data = weather_data[['Date', 'Snowfall']]\n   snowfall_occurrences = snowfall_data[snowfall_data['Snowfall'] > 0].shape[0]\n   total_years = weather_data.shape[0]\n   probability = (snowfall_occurrences / total_years) * 100\n\n   print(f\"Probability of snowfall on New Year's Eve: {probability:.2f}%\")\n   ```\n2. **API Fetch Code** (note: placeholders need valid values):\n   ```python\n   import requests\n   import pandas as pd\n   from datetime import datetime\n\n   API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'\n   LOCATION = 'Chicago,IL'\n   START_YEAR = 2014\n   END_YEAR = 2023\n\n   data = []\n   for year in range(START_YEAR, END_YEAR + 1):\n       date = f'{year}-12-31'\n       response = requests.get(f'API_ENDPOINT?date={date}&location={LOCATION}&key={API_KEY}')\n       if response.status_code == 200:\n           weather_data = response.json()\n           snowfall = weather_data.get('snowfall', 0)\n           data.append({'Date': date, 'Snowfall': snowfall})\n       else:\n           print(f\"Failed to retrieve data for {date}\")\n\n   weather_df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n   snowfall_occurrences = weather_df[weather_df['Snowfall'] > 0].shape[0]\n   total_years = weather_df.shape[0]\n   probability = (snowfall_occurrences / total_years) * 100\n\n   print(f\"Probability of snowfall on New Year's Eve: {probability:.2f}%\")\n   ``` ",
